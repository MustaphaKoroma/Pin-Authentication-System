# Pin-Authentication-System
A secure console-based PIN authentication system built with Python to demonstrate clean code structure and basic security principles.

## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to build a secure, console-based PIN authentication system in Python that demonstrates clean code structure, basic security awareness, and testable design using core Python features.

## Overview
This project simulates a real-world PIN-based authentication flow similar to those used in ATM machines, mobile money applications, and access-controlled systems.

The system limits login attempts, hides sensitive input, and verifies credentials securely using hashing.

## Features
- Secure PIN verification using SHA-256 hashing
- Hidden PIN input via `getpass`
- Limited login attempts
- Account lock after repeated failures
- Modular and testable code structure

## Programming Language Used
- Python 3
- Python Standard Library
